## Refactoring Checklist for Code Organization

To clean up and organize the VideoPlayerElectron app, follow this checklist. This focuses on improving maintainability, readability, and scalability of the codebase.

### 1. File Structure Organization
- [ ] Organize `src/main/` into subfolders:
  - Create `src/main/windows/` for window management (e.g., mainWindow.ts, multiPlayerWindow.ts).
  - Create `src/main/menus/` for context menus (e.g., contextMenu.ts).
  - Create `src/main/ipc/` for IPC handlers (e.g., libraryManager.ts).
  - Move `main.ts` to `src/main/main.ts` if not already.
- [ ] Organize `src/renderer/src/` into subfolders:
  - Create `src/renderer/src/components/` for reusable UI components.
  - Create `src/renderer/src/pages/` for page-level components (e.g., MultiPlayer.tsx).
  - Create `src/renderer/src/hooks/` for custom React hooks.
  - Create `src/renderer/src/utils/` for utility functions.
  - Create `src/renderer/src/types/` for TypeScript type definitions.
- [ ] Ensure consistent naming conventions (e.g., PascalCase for components, camelCase for files).
- [ ] Update import paths in all files to reflect new structure.

### 2. Code Modularization
- [ ] Break down large files:
  - Split `main.ts` into smaller modules if it contains multiple responsibilities.
  - Extract reusable functions from components into separate files.
- [ ] Separate concerns:
  - Move business logic out of UI components into services or hooks.
  - Ensure IPC handlers are isolated and testable.
- [ ] Implement dependency injection where appropriate (e.g., for library management).

### 3. TypeScript Improvements
- [ ] Add comprehensive type definitions:
  - Define interfaces for video items, library data, etc.
  - Use generics where applicable.
- [ ] Ensure type safety across processes:
  - Define shared types for IPC communication.
  - Use `global.d.ts` for window API extensions.
- [ ] Enable strict TypeScript settings in `tsconfig.json` files.

### 4. Error Handling and Logging
- [ ] Add error handling:
  - Wrap IPC calls in try-catch blocks.
  - Handle file system errors gracefully.
- [ ] Implement logging:
  - Use a logging library (e.g., winston) for main process.
  - Add console logging for renderer with appropriate levels.
- [ ] Add user-friendly error messages in the UI.

### 5. Dependency Management
- [ ] Update `package.json`:
  - Add scripts for linting, formatting, and testing.
  - Ensure all dependencies are up-to-date and remove unused ones.
- [ ] Use environment variables for configuration (e.g., dev vs. prod settings).
- [ ] Add a `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` for reproducible builds.

### 6. Documentation
- [ ] Add code comments:
  - Document complex functions and classes.
  - Add JSDoc comments for public APIs.
- [ ] Update README.md:
  - Include architecture overview.
  - Document setup and development process.
  - Add API documentation for IPC channels.
- [ ] Create a CONTRIBUTING.md for development guidelines.

### 7. Testing Setup
- [ ] Set up testing framework:
  - Add Jest or Vitest for unit tests.
  - Add testing utilities for Electron (e.g., spectron or playwright).
- [ ] Write basic tests:
  - Unit tests for utility functions.
  - Integration tests for IPC communication.
- [ ] Add CI/CD pipeline for automated testing.

### 8. Performance and Best Practices
- [ ] Optimize imports:
  - Use tree-shaking friendly imports.
  - Avoid circular dependencies.
- [ ] Secure IPC:
  - Validate inputs in IPC handlers.
  - Limit exposed APIs in preload script.
- [ ] Add performance monitoring:
  - Monitor memory usage in video playback.
  - Optimize rendering for large libraries.
- [ ] Implement accessibility features (e.g., ARIA labels, keyboard navigation).

### 9. Multi-Player Feature Integration
- [ ] Organize Multi-Player code:
  - Place MultiPlayer.tsx in `src/renderer/src/pages/`.
  - Ensure related types are in `src/renderer/src/types/`.
- [ ] Integrate with existing library:
  - Connect mockLibrary to real libraryManager.
  - Ensure IPC for search is properly handled.
- [ ] Add persistence:
  - Use localStorage for user preferences (e.g., grid layout).
- [ ] Test Multi-Player functionality:
  - Ensure video controls work independently.
  - Handle edge cases (e.g., invalid video files).

### 10. Final Steps
- [ ] Run linting and formatting tools.
- [ ] Perform a full build and test the app.
- [ ] Review and merge changes incrementally.
- [ ] Update version and release notes if applicable.
